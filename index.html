        <p>Hello! My name is Etim Frank and I live in Lagos, Nigeria. I find pleasure solving critical problems that
            involves physics and mathematics with real-life problems.
            I enjoy travelling and being creative. I am currently studying web design and Development at BYU-Idaho. I
            feel very excited to learn
            more about web development and design.
            I am looking forward to exploring the knowledge I acquire in solving problems relating to web and computer
            programming. Surely it is what it is! God willing.</p>
