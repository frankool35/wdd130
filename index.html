        <p>Hello! My name is Etim Frank and I live in Lagos, Nigeria. I find pleasure solving critical problems that
            involves physics and mathematics, and also real-life problems.
             I also enjoy travelling and meeting people. I am currently studying web Design and Development at BYU-Idaho online degree. I feel very excited to learn
            more about web development and design.
             I am looking forward to exploring the knowledge I acquire in solving problems relating to web and computer programming. 
    I hope I can bring this into light someday! God willing.</p>
